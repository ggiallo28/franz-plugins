# Franz 5 - Plugins/Recipes
[Franz 5](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz) plugins are now called __recipes__.

## How to install a recipe
In Franz 5, recipes are now served via a central repository. Except for development purposes you don't need to manually install a recipe any longer.

You can install it manually by following the instructions below.

1. Download this recipe.
2. Open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine:
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
Create the `dev` folder if you don't have it yet.
3. Unzip the zip file you have downloaded
4. Copy the `recipe-franz-website-master` folder into the plugins dev directory
4. Reload Franz
5. Open Franz settings. Under 'available services' you will find a 'Development' section. Click on 'Website' and start configuring

__To add a new service:__
* Go to your Franz 5 App
* Search & add the required service
* Et voila, simple as that!
